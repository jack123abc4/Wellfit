# Wellfit

## Description

Wellfit is an application designed to make cooking healthy meals easier! The user is able to search through a database of recipes as well as find relavent Youtube videos in order to make food prep as easy as possible. Each recipe has nutritional information available, either for the recipe as a whole or for individual ingredients. The user can subtract or replace ingredients if they don't have certain ones on hand or would like to make a dietary substitution. Recipes can be saved for future access and viewed at any time in the Favorites tab.

## Usage

This program can be accessed from the user's browser. From the landing page a user can navigate to any of the website's pages via the navigation bar. 

To search recipes, click the "Recipes" tab and search keywords to display a list of relavent recipes. Clicking on one of these thumbnails will bring the user to the corresponding recipe page. From here, the user can view the total nutritional information or click on any individual ingredient to see it's nutritional value. Clicking on an ingredient also provides the user with the choice to subtract or substitute this ingredient. The nutritional information will update accordingly. From the recipe page a user can also save the recipe for later viewing.

To search videos, click the "Videos" tab and search keywords to display a list of relavent videos. These videos are embedded into the Wellfit website and can be viewed without leaving the page.

To revist favorited videos, click the "Favorites" tab. Any recipe that has been previously saved will appear here.
